StateSelect
=============

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of states.  The list of states comes from an ActiveRecord model.

Based on the original work of Michael Koziarski on country_select

Example
=======

state_select("user", "state_name")

The plugin defaults to using the "State" model with field "Name". Override STATE_SELECT_MODEL_NAME and STATE_SELECT_MODEL_FIELD for different behavior.
